            <h2>hi, my name's jia and welcome to my crochet business!</h2>
            <br>
            <p>everything you see here i created myself, from this website to the crochet products i'm selling (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)</p>
            <br>
            <p>crochet is one of my favourite hobbies and i love making things for others (one of my love languages),</p>
            <p>so i thought i should make more people happy with my creations!</p>
            <br>
            <p>handmade crocheted items are usually quite pricey (from what i've seen on etsy) due to the amount of hours put into making each piece</p>
            <p>so i decided to make my brand more affordable so more people can enjoy cute clothes and accessories!</p>
            <br>
            <p>i am also open to offers and new ideas, so please share them with me via instagram dm @jia.lxc ! (no business instagram yet XD)</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>about me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>i'm a 2nd year computer science student at aston university!</p>
            <p>i wonder if that is a shock or not...</p>
            <br>
            <p>my crochet hobby began in sixth form, and the first time i learned to crochet was a trainwreck and a half!</p>
            <p>i actually gave up after that and picked it back up again months later, now i'm taking it more seriously and you are reading this ^_^</p>
            <br>
            <p>my expertise is in clothes: i've made many flower lace jumpers and cardigans!</p>
            <p>i've also made fingerless gloves and scarves for the colder months</p>
            <p>like i said before, i'm open to new ideas to expand my creativity and cater to everyone!</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>plans moving forward...</h2>
            <br>
            <p>i sincerely hope anyone who has something i've crocheted truly enjoys it! that is all i can ask for</p>
            <p>it is one of the greatest joys to see someone appreciate the hard work you put into making them happy!</p>
            <br>
            <p>i hope as i continue doing this, i will have more than 3 products listed (üò≠) and i can cater to everyone as much as possible</p>
            <p>i'm still a uni student but i'm forever a hustler #diva</p>
            <br>
            <p>if you've read this far, thank you for staying and hope to hear from you soon!</p>
