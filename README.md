# crojiachet

**a website showcasing my crocheted products that are for sale for my small business called crojiachet.**

the aesthetic of this website, and my brand, is minimalistic yet elegant. i carefully chose the font, colours and images used to give this impression.

in this website, you can navigate to the home, shop, collections, how to order, about and contact pages.


home: the page you see as soon as you open the site and has a button that redirects you to the 'shop' page.
