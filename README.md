# crojiachet

**a website showcasing my crocheted products that are for sale for my business called crojiachet.**

the aesthetic of this website, and my brand, is minimalistic yet elegant. i carefully chose the font, colours and images used to give this impression.

in this website, you can navigate to the home, shop, collections, about and contact pages.
